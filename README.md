# Arduino-Projects
This repository groups some of the Arduino Programs I have done. 

# 1LEDblinking1Hz.ino

LED connected to an output pin blinking with the frequency of 1Hz. 

# 2LEDOpposite.ino

Define two ports and connect two LEDs and have them blink in opposite (once first is ON the other is OFF and vice versa).

# slavereceiver2.ino

Sends data to another Arduino boad. When a button is clicked, a random number is generated. The program then checks if the number is Prime or not. If it is Prime, the board sends a message to the Master board and turns on an LED for 1 second. Otherwise the LED turns on for 0.2 seconds.
